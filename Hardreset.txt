ESP32 C3 

. The "Physical" Force Boot
Sometimes the buttons on these mini boards are a bit finicky. If the standard sequence isn't working, follow this strictly:

Unplug the board from your Mac.

Press and hold the BOOT button (labeled BOOT or 9).

Plug in the USB cable while still holding the button.

Wait 2 seconds, then release the button.

Now try running the command again:

Bash

python3 -m esptool --port /dev/cu.usbmodem1101 --chip esp32c3 erase-flash
